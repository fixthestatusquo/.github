Proca by Fix the Status Quo is a digital action toolkit for campaigners which allows campaign actions to be embedded on your website. 
Proca Widgets can be used for actions such as signing petitions and twitterstorms, mail-to-target, social media campaigns and more. 
Supporter sign-ups can be collected and stored securely, actions taken are tracked so you can see what works well, and social media share options can be easily integrated.
