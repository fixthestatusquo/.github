Proca by Fix the Status Quo is a digital action toolkit for campaigners which allows campaign actions to be embedded on your website. 
Proca Widgets can be used for actions such as signing petitions and twitterstorms, mail-to-target, social media campaigns and more. 
Supporter sign-ups can be collected and stored securely, actions taken are tracked so you can see what works well, and social media share options can be easily integrated.

# Community and code of conduct

Our vision is for radical change in society in a socialist, feminist, antiracist and sustainable direction. Our role within that is to make online campaigning easier and more effective and we are building a flexible and easy to use action tool which has all the useful features to help progressive campaigners change the world. We hope to help grow a diverse online community of progressive campaigners, technologists and activists who will support each other, share tricks and stories and grow together.
